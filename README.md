# Smart Traffic Simulator for Urban Intersections

## how to use the simulator

The simulator uses Python3.9 as the environment. At first, the users need to download the Pygame, NumPy, and Scipy packages. After that, users need to compile the code which is named "smart\_2lanes" in the "examples" folder. In this way, users can enter the simulator.

In the user interface, there are two lines of buttons.

The first line is the different weights of traffic flow. Users can use these buttons to test the influence of the different weights of traffic flow. The second line  means the different lengths of the buffer area. Users can use these buttons to test the influence of the length of the buffer area.

At the same time, there are two different vertical areas. The first part is the test for the intersection with a traffic light, and the second part  is the intersection without a traffic light. Users can use these buttons to test the two different scenes.

The section in the corner is the controller of the traffic flow and velocity. Users can control the two different parameters.
